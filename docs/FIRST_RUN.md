# First-run setup

The first time BartleBot opens, it asks what a first run needs, one page at a time. Every
page writes a real setting, the same one its Settings row writes, and the whole walk can
be run again from **File › Set up BartleBot…**. The plan behind it is epic #215
(`docs/FIRST_RUN_SETUP.md`).

The code is `bartlebot/gui/dialogs/first_run_dialog.py`; what a page stores lives in a
Qt-free module, so BartleBuddy can ask the same question and write the same keys.

## The walk

1. **Quick or Custom.** Two cards, Quick first, recommended and selected. The choice is
   not stored: it only decides which pages follow. Custom adds pages Quick applies at
   their defaults (none yet: the Options page arrives with #232).
2. **Every page after it that applies.** A page applies under the mode chosen and with
   what is set up so far.

The footer is **Back** and **Next**, and on the last page that applies, **Finish**. Under
the heading, **Step N of M**, where M counts the pages that apply now, Quick or Custom
included, so choosing Custom can change it.

- **Next records the page shown**, and moves on only once that reached disk. A failed
  write keeps the user on the page, says so under it, and logs a warning.
- **Back records nothing.**
- **There is no Skip.** Escape and the close button reject and write nothing more. What
  was answered stays answered, and the next launch opens on the pages still unanswered.

## First run and rerun

`AppController._offer_first_run` builds the pages (`setup_pages`) and opens the dialog
when any page is unanswered. It runs from `_after_window_shown`, before a file named at
launch is imported, so the two modals never stack.

- **A first run** walks the pages unanswered when the dialog opened. A page answered on
  the way stays in the walk, so Back still reaches it.
- **A rerun**, from File › Set up BartleBot… (after Settings…), walks every page that
  applies, each on the current value.

After either, the Combat tab rereads its source, since the combat page may have changed
the Team default.

## The pages

| page | writes | answered when |
|---|---|---|
| Quick or Custom | nothing | never: it is always the first page |
| How should your team take on bosses? | the Team default, through `shared/first_run.record_answer`, and `setup.combat_defaults_answered` in `preferences.json` | `combat_question_answered`: the key is set (by either product, or #209's Skip), or the Team default is a duel neither answer names |

### The combat question

Two cards, the recommended answer (one hitter, the others support) first.
`docs/COMBAT_CONFIG.md` ("First run: one question about the team") has what each answer
stores. The page opens on the answer the stored Team default already is. On a rerun that
default can be a duel neither answer names, chosen in Settings › Combat; then no card is
selected, and Next with none selected keeps that duel and records only the key.
